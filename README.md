# Project 6: Spots - An image sharing site

## Description

This website allows creators to upload photos using a link and add a photo caption. There is also a like button for users to indicate which photos they like best.

For the website layout, I utilized Figma. I added buttons with hover states, text-overflow settings, made buttons functional using JavaScript and made the website responsive to a phone, tablet, and different desktop sizes.
