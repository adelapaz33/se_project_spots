# Project 3: Spots - An image sharing site

## Description

This website allows creators to upload photos and add a short photo description. There is also a like button for users to indicate which photos they like best.

For the website layout, I utilized Figma. I added buttons with hover states, text-overflow settings, and made the website responsive to a phone, tablet, and different desktop sizes.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
